# Facial Expression Recognition System for Food Product Testing using Deep Learning

## Build with

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Dataset

- The **Eating Behavior Detection** dataset was collected by us, consisting of 14 university students.
- The **Facial Expression Recognition** is trained and tested on a mixture of CK+ and JAFFE datasets.

## Used libraries
- cv2
- Numpy
- Keras
- datetime
- sklearn
- mlxtend
- preparation
- detection
- behavior
- expression
- plot

## Usage
To run the program, just type:
```python
python main.py --video {VIDEO_PATH}
```
Then the program will display FER graph of your video.
