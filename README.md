# Facial Expression Recognition System for Food Product Testing using Deep Learning

## Build with

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Dataset

- The **Eating Behavior Detection** dataset was collected by us, consisting of 14 university students.
- The **Facial Expression Recognition** is trained and tested on a mixture of CK+ and JAFFE datasets.

## Used libraries
- cv2
- Numpy
- Keras
- datetime

## Usage
To run the program, please place your test video file to "./dataset/test/" and change 'test.mp4' in 'main.py' line 70 to your filename.
```python
vdo_path = "./dataset/test/test.mp4" #change fliename here
```
then, type:
```python
python main.py
